"""Potential new idea:

1. recursively create a stack for as long as we can move down.
2. When we change direction from either left or right to down:
3. Add a new source to the higher level source stack.
4. if the current source ends up in the visited: continue with the inner stack

6 nvfm: we again have the same problem of ending up in flowing water and
    breaking: TODO: think about solution between still water and flowing water
    in dfs/bfs appoach.

# 4. Discontinue a stack frame if any position reaches below the maxr

# NOTE: problem: buckets inside of buckets: we don't go back up the source
# stack to start dropping from higher up, so maybe we could do that? Keep a
# stack of source coords and if the current source end up in the water/visited
# set, we simply go back to the previous source coord? Might be tricky though
# since now we just keep adding the current source if there are no break
# conditions so we might need to change that also *shrug*.
# another thing, maybe there is a better way to add sources both from the left
# and right when overflowing, but we might get back to the same problem that is
# how do we backtrack if we just add all the sources at every intersection?

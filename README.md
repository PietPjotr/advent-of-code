# advent-of-code
my solutions for advent of code. For most files I seperate the part one and two in two different functions called 'deel1' and 'deel2' respectively. 
Exceptions so far: dag5.py, dag10.py (this file only contains part2 since parts of part 1 became useless for part 2 and I did not feel like chaning it back after completing part2. basically change the if condition and part one is done again.)
